# decentreelized

This project will sell a tree for 1 Ether. Farmer will get 0.1 for each year. So, only after 10 years it will get total amount. 
Who bought the tree can ask for a refund anytime and will get the remain balance. For example, if after 3 years, user calls **refund** function, it will reimburse 0.7 Ether. 

TreeID will be the coordinate of the tree. This project will use What3Words to identify one tree. For example, [https://map.what3words.com/visibly.tins.heroics](tree)
